This is a semi-restricted security repository. Some applications here will be public, but passworded. If you can
manage to exploit these and break them open, please submit an issue request and publicly disclose the
presence of hard-coded credentials. I'll try my *absolute best* to not have hard-coded credentials. Please
do not weaponize these exploits or security tools. These are for private access (mostly). Sometimes I'll place
a public, non-passworded exploit for you guys.

AB - Authentication Bypass
RCE - Remote Code Execution
LPE - Local Privs Escalation (within the application)
HCC - Hard-Coded Credentials Discovery
DOS - Denial of Service
NFC - No functionality.
SRCA - Source Code Access
GNRC - Generic Crash
ALL - All vulnerabilities welcome.
Vulnerabilities are in the second set of parenthesis and are ordered by priority.
